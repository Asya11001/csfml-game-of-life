## Software Development Team Requirements

We are a small software development team focused on C programming language. 
In order to ensure consistency and maintainability within our codebase, 
we have the following requirements for our developers:

1. **Naming Convention:**
    - Use camelCase for all variable and function names.
   Example: `myVariable`, `calculateSum()`

2. **Function Size Limit:**
    - Limit the size of functions to 30-35 lines of code.
    - Aim for concise and modular functions that are easier to understand and maintain.

3. **Clear Condition Variables:**
   - If the condition in a function is not obvious, assign it to a separate variable with a descriptive name.
   - This helps improve code readability and makes the intent of the condition clearer.

   Example:

   ```c
   // Bad practice: Using a complex condition directly in the function
   int calculateGrade(int score) {
       if (score >= 90 && score <= 100) {
           return 'A';
       } else if (score >= 80 && score < 90) {
           return 'B';
       } else if (score >= 70 && score < 80) {
           return 'C';
       } else {
           return 'F';
       }
   }
   ```

   ```c
   // Good practice: Assign the condition to a clear variable
   int calculateGrade(int score) {
       bool isExcellent = (score >= 90 && score <= 100);
       bool isGood = (score >= 80 && score < 90);
       bool isSatisfactory = (score >= 70 && score < 80);

       if (isExcellent) {
           return 'A';
       } else if (isGood) {
           return 'B';
       } else if (isSatisfactory) {
           return 'C';
       } else {
           return 'F';
       }
   }
   ```

   In the example above, using a complex condition directly in the function might make it harder to understand the criteria for different grades. By assigning the conditions to separate variables with descriptive names, such as `isExcellent`, `isGood`, and `isSatisfactory`, the code becomes more self-explanatory, making it easier for other developers to grasp the logic behind the grade calculation.

4. **Avoid Magic Numbers:**
   - Avoid the use of "magic numbers" in the code.
   - Declare variables with descriptive names to hold values that might otherwise be considered arbitrary or unclear.
   - This enhances code maintainability and makes it easier to understand the purpose of specific values.

   Example:

   ```c
   // Bad practice: Using magic numbers
   int calculateTotalPrice(int quantity) {
       return quantity * 10; // 10 is a magic number representing the price per item
   }
   ```

   ```c
   // Good practice: Declare a constant variable with a descriptive name
   const int PRICE_PER_ITEM = 10;

   int calculateTotalPrice(int quantity) {
       return quantity * PRICE_PER_ITEM;
   }
   ```

   In the example above, using a magic number like `10` without any explanation may make the code less readable and harder to maintain. 
By declaring a constant variable named `PRICE_PER_ITEM` with a descriptive name, 
the code becomes more self-explanatory, 
making it easier for other developers to understand the purpose of the value.

5. **Nesting Limit:**
   - Limit the level of nesting in control structures (such as if statements and loops) to a maximum of 3 levels.
   - Excessive nesting can lead to code complexity and reduced readability, so it's important to keep it at a manageable level.

6. **Modularize Code from the Start:**
   - Divide the work into functions right from the beginning of the development process.
   - Avoid the temptation to think, "I will split it later" 
   and instead proactively design and implement modular functions from the outset.
   - This approach ensures that code is organized, reusable, and easier to understand, right from the start of the development process.

7. **Code Performance Optimization:**
   - Strive for code efficiency and optimize performance when necessary.
   - Profile and analyze code to identify bottlenecks and optimize critical sections for improved execution speed and resource utilization.

8. **Write Unit-Testable Functions:**
   - Design and implement functions that are easily testable in isolation.
   - Keep functions small, focused, and with well-defined responsibilities to facilitate unit testing.
   - Avoid complex dependencies or tightly coupled code that makes unit testing difficult.

9. **Write Secure Functions:**
   - Pay attention to different behaviors and edge cases of the function to ensure it operates securely without causing crashes or vulnerabilities.
   - Validate input parameters and handle potential errors, edge cases, and unexpected scenarios gracefully.
   - Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms, such as error codes, exceptions, or return values, to prevent program crashes and ensure the stability of the overall system.

10. **Use Ternary Operator Judiciously:**
    - Utilize the ternary operator (`? :`) only when its usability is clear and obvious.
    - Prioritize code readability and maintainability over compactness.
    - Avoid using nested or complex ternary expressions that may impair code understanding or introduce unnecessary complexity.

11. **Write Clear and Readable Comments:**
    - When writing comments, ensure they are easy to read and understand for both yourself and other members of the team.
    - Use clear and concise language, avoiding jargon or overly technical terms.
    - Provide relevant context, explanations, or reasoning behind the code to aid comprehension and facilitate future maintenance.

12. **Utilize Function Return Values for Error Handling:**
    - When a function you are using returns a value that can help in detecting or handling errors, ensure that you utilize that return value appropriately.
    - Check and evaluate the return value of functions that provide error codes, statuses, or meaningful results.
    - Use the returned value to catch and handle potential errors or unexpected behaviors in a proactive manner.
